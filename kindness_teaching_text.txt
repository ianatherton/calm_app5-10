this is what should be done 
by one who is skilled in goodness, 
having glimpsed the state of perfect calm: 
let them be honest and upright, 
straightforward and gentle in speech, 
humble and not conceited, 
contented and easily satisfied 
unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways 
peaceful and calm and wise and skillful, 
not proud or demanding in nature 
let them not do the slightest thing 
that the wise would later reprove 
wishing: in gladness and in safety, 
may all beings be happy 
whatever living beings there may be; 
whether they are weak or strong, excluding none, 
the great or the mighty, medium short or small 
those seen or unseen, 
those near or far away, 
those born or yet to be born
may all beings be at ease! 
let none deceive another, 
or despise any being in any state 
let none through anger or ill-will 
wish harm upon another 
even as a mother protects with her life
her child, her only child
so with a boundless heart
should one cherish all living beings;
cultivate a limitless heart of goodwill
for all throughout the cosmos
in all its height, depth and breadth-
a love that is untroubled 
and beyond hatred and ill-will
whether standing or walking, sitting or lying, 
as long as we are awake, 
maintain this mindfulness of love 
this is the noblest way of living.
free from wrong views, greed, and sensual desires, 
living in beauty and realizing perfect understanding, 
those who practice boundless love 
will certainly transcend birth and death
